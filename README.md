# Kea

## Description

I will be using this project as a vehicle to teach others how to take a concept and build it in to a full application.

Kea is a project to build an application for downloading data files that are on the web and meet specific search criteria. This project has been started in May of 2023, and is not anything more than a concept yet. It is something that I will build as a part of my online content (i.e. blogs, videos, etc.). I chose this as the first application to use because I want to use this application to download data to be used in future scenarios.
